## How it works
The application functions through a collaborative and iterative process involving multiple specialized agents, each dedicated to a specific task in the article creation workflow. Initially, a draft is generated based on a given theme or short story. The user then engages in a conversational dialogue with the LLM agents, providing feedback and specific requests.

- **Source and Story Agent:** This agent focuses on searching for credible sources and uncovering relevant stories to enrich the article's content.
- **Fact-Checking Agent:** Dedicated to verifying the accuracy of information, this agent ensures that the article is trustworthy and factually correct.
- **Styling Agent:** This agent refines the article's style, tone, and structure, ensuring it meets journalistic standards and aligns with the user's preferences.

Through this interactive process, the agents work together to iteratively build and adapt the article, addressing all aspects necessary to craft a compelling and reliable news piece. This multi-agent approach ensures that the final output is both comprehensive and tailored to the user's expectations.
